One of the goals I set in creating this site was to not only showcase my abilities, but to accelerate my knowledge and understanding of new technologies. I started this website as a simple bootstrap template back in 2013 and have slowly added to it over the years. My modus operandi has been to:
- decide which features are important
- iterate 10x
- tear everything down and start over again
- ask for feedback from my friends. Ask again when no one gives me feedback.
- know when to stop
