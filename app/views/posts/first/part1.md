Hello and welcome. I decided to create a website and a blog. And rather than building something from Wordpress, Squarespace, Devpost, Gatsby, Ghost, or Medium, I wanted to create something on my own from scratch. And so, here I am, hacking away at something that won't immediately scale*, but will hopefully help me grow as an engineer.

If you visit my repository ([here](https://github.com/mldangelo/mldangelo)) you can see how my site has changed over time from a static page ([here](https://github.com/mldangelo/mldangelo/tree/e58fa5163dba0b51b018d1d3e0b5b113fe55976b)) to what it is today. My modus operandi has been to:
- decide which features are important.
- build the most important or easiest to implement ones.
- iterate. tear everything down and start over again.
- ask for feedback from my friends. Ask again when no one gives me feedback.
- know when to stop.

As I explore my thoughts, concepts, and (often silly) ideas, I'll continue to refactor and improve this site. Instead of boring you with more text. Here's an example of what you can expect in future posts.

This is a quick and dirty version of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life). The board contains 50x50 cells and each iteration takes 100ms. You can paint more cells by clicking and dragging over the board.
