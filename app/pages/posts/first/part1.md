So, I decided to create a blog. And rather than building something from Wordpress, Squarespace, Devpost, Gatsby, or Medium, I wanted to build my own from scratch. And so, here I am, hacking away at something that won't immediately scale*, but will hopefully help me grow as an engineer. If you visit my repository ([here](https://github.com/mldangelo/mldangelo)) you can see how my site has changed over time from a static page ([here](https://github.com/mldangelo/mldangelo/tree/e58fa5163dba0b51b018d1d3e0b5b113fe55976b)) to what it is today. It's my hope that as I explore my thoughts, concepts, and (often silly) ideas, I'll continue to refactor and improve this site. Instead of boring you with more text. Here's an example of the type of things you can expect in future posts.
